  * The Real World shows students how personally relevant sociology can be with a clever mix of popular culture, everyday life, and extensive student activities. Professors describe the book as “hip and accessible,” and students love the authors’ contemporary examples and emphasis on students’ experiences.
 
  * The Real World is the only book to integrate Data Workshops into every chapter, giving students an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the practice of sociology. New to the Second Edition are “Theory in Everyday Life” tables, which apply key sociological theories to real life.
